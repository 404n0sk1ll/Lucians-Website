  <h1>(My) Perspectives for Reasonable Software Design</h1>
  <p>I think this perspective is incredibly useful, though it isn’t always easy. In my line of work, it’s often framed as the role of a Product Owner. In practice, it’s simply anyone who will ask you to add or change things in the future. Usually, this person has little to no understanding of what those changes actually involve. What they want is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A quick turnaround time</li>
    <li>Exactly what they ask for</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The goal is to notice when you’ve painted yourself into a corner, where delivering what they want would be difficult. It’s important to stay realistic about this perspective. You shouldn’t waste time building features or capabilities you don’t actually need. But you should always leave yourself enough space to add and change things later.</p>  <p>Consider how complex the goals of this code really are. Sometimes complexity is unavoidable, but you should be cautious about adding unnecessary layers of abstraction.</p>  <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>It’s important to remember that each perspective comes with different goals and expectations. Some will understand your decisions better than others. What feels like an obvious limitation to you may not seem obvious or reasonable to them. Try to capture as much of that reality as you can.</p>  <p>I’ve always found this process useful for finding the best path forward. The next time you’re deciding how to solve a problem, try applying these perspectives and see if they help you as well. Good luck.</p>
